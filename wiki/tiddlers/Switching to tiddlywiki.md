For the past several years I've tried a number of ways to store and share knowledge:

- a [`til`](https://github.com/alexashley/til) Git repo
- GitHub [Gists](https://gist.github.com/alexashley/)
- emails or Slack messages (no really, I have hundreds of messages in my personal Slack channel)
- blog posts
- Google Keep

But nothing really stuck -- each solution had its own downside. Either was too private and not shareable or not easily searchable/discoverable by my future self.  After hearing a lot of praise for [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) I decided to give it a shot. Currently, I'm just a few hours in (mostly spent manually importing tiddlers from other channels); I'm really enjoying the straight forward tagging and editing. Here's hoping that this becomes my actual, personal knowledge base.
